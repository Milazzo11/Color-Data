The original intent of this program was to graph surveyed happiness levels against different color percentages in an RGB value.
It takes in a TXT file with multiple lines containing a HEX code and a numeric value.

This program can be used to analyze data for anything related to RGB (happiness levels were just the original intended graph)

Enjoy :)
